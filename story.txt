Title: The Galactic Adventure

Dear [Jacob],

I am writing to you from a [spectacular] spaceship in a [moody] galaxy. I found myself here one day after
going for a ride on a [orange] rocket in [March]. There are [four] [basketballs] and [salamanders] of [ribbon] here! In the
[hall closet] there is a pool full of [honey]. I fall asleep each night on a [bright] bed of
[carbon fiber] and dream of [fishing] [instantaneously]. It feels as though I have lived here for
[three] [epoch]. I hope one day you can visit, although the only way to get here now is
[star lifting] on a [irrational] [curvature drive ship]!!

Best wishes,
[Xuan Ma]
