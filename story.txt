Title: The Galactic Adventure

Dear Luo Ji,

I am writing to you from a invisible spaceship in a chaotic galaxy. I found myself here one day after
going for a ride on a dark rocket in June. There are four Sophons and Doomsday Battleships of Wallfacer here! In the
command center there is a pool full of Degenerate matter. I fall asleep each night on a relativistic bed of
strong interaction material and dream of dimensional folding instantaneously. It feels as though I have lived here for
three epoch. I hope one day you can visit, although the only way to get here now is
star lifting on a irrational curvature drive ship!!

Best wishes,
Xuan Ma
